# Animal Image Classification with CNN & Transfer Learning

This deep learning project focuses on image classification using the Animals10 dataset. We designed and optimized CNN models from scratch, implemented transfer learning with pre-trained models, and evaluated generalization on new datasets with fewer samples.

## Key Achievements

- **Custom CNN Design**: Designed and trained a compact CNN on the Animals10 dataset, keeping model size under 400,000 parameters.
- **Regularization & Optimization**:
  - Controlled overfitting using techniques like dropout and data augmentation.
  - Performed hyperparameter tuning and tested various optimizers.
- **Transfer Learning**:
  - Fine-tuned pre-trained models (ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2) on new datasets such as:
    - Dog Sentiment Classification
    - Dog, Cat, Horse Classification
- **Evaluation**:
  - Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
  - Plotted learning curves and ROC curves.
  - Visualized predictions on real test images.

## Techniques Used

- CNN Architecture Design
- Parameter Constraints & Re-Training
- Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning
- Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, F1, ROC)
- Visualization of Prediction Results
